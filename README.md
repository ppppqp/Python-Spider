# Python-Spider

This is the repository for web spiders in python.

1. **Chow Tai Fook**: The spyder uses beautiful soup to implement. It grabs the data from the official website of this Jelwery Company. The code is written when I was engaged in Bayen Cup competition.
2. **TaoBao**: The spyder uses selenium to simulate the "next page" action and grabs the data of comodities on your search command. You can customize your search result by modifying your code a little bit. Also, you need a Taobao account to login at the start of the process, but you don't need to repeat loging in after that.
3. **SJTU Paper System**: This spyder is designed only for SJTU students and those who own SJTU VPN. The brief version of the program grabs the information of title, mentor, school, etc. of all the paper in a certain year. The verbose version provides more information, but is less stable. For this program, you can modify the search type and put in any search key in the program to customize the information you grab.
